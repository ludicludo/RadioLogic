Abstract: (997 characters)

Case-based learning (CBL) is an efficient method for radiologist education. RadioLogic is a system to create clinical cases from real DICOM files and provides a self-assessment tool to view the studies, submit a diagnosis and compare the performance with peers. The main components are a progressive web application and an Orthanc plugin to create and serve the teaching cases. The user selects a learning module, views the cases, submits his diagnosis and checks the results (Fig. 1). The teacher selects a patient, study, series or instance inside an Orthanc server to start the creation of a clinical case in a webpage. He enters the name of the clinical case, the choices for a possible diagnosis, the answer and two images showing clinical data and explanations about the correct diagnosis (Fig. 2). An asynchronous job is started in the Orthanc job engine to customize and compress the case and to generate two DICOM files from these images including private tags to hold the submitted data.
